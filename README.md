# Disease-Prediction
Prediction of Disease Outbreak is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a person is likely to have Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Parkinson’s Disease based on user input data.

The project leverages Scikit-learn models trained on healthcare datasets and provides predictions through an interactive Streamlit web interface. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied in the healthcare domain to support early detection and awareness of diseases.

🚀 Features

User-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

Multiple disease prediction (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s).

Data preprocessing using NumPy and Pandas.

Machine learning models trained with Scikit-learn.

Modular, scalable, and easy to deploy.
